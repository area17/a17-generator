#A17 Generator

A17 generator is used to quickly generate a boilerplate.

## Usage

**Install A17 generator globally**

  ```shell
  $ npm install -g @area17/a17-generator
  ```

**Go to the root of your project**

  ```shell
  $ cd project-root
  ```

**Initialize the frontend boilerplate**

  ```shell
  # @ ~/project-root
  $ a17-generator [project-name]

Now you will have a `frontend` folder, a `package.json` file and all the node modules.

  ```
