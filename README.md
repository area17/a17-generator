A17 Generator is used to quickly generate an [A17 Boilerplate](https://code.area17.com/a17/fe-boilerplate/tree/master).

## Usage

**Install A17 Generator globally**

  ```shell
  $ npm install -g @area17/a17-generator

**Go to the root of your project**

  ```shell
  $ cd project-root
  ```

**Initialize the A17 Boilerplate**
